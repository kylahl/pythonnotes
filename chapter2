notes:

    - python tasks are generally about 1. interacting with the world (reading/ writing to files)
                                       2. preparing (transforming data for analysis)
                                       3. transformation (applying formulas)
                                       4. modeling and computation (connecting data to models, algorithms, etc.)
                                       5. presentation (visualizations)
    - book says to type:
    
    ipython --pylab

    - this will run iPython in Pylab
