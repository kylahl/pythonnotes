notes:
    - one reason python stands out is because it is easy to intergrate C, C++, and FORTRAN code 
    - pyton is an interperted programming language 
    - typically, python is slower than compiled languages, like Java or C++

libraries:
    1. NumPy: foundational package for scientific computing. most of the book is written using NumPy
    2. pandas: name comes from panel data. used for structured data. python is similar to r (e.g. data.frame in r and DataFrame in python)
    3. IPython: used for runnning, debugging and testing

installation:
    - Google Anaconda installer for Apple
    - click Installing on macOS - Anaconda Documentation
    - under the macOS graphical install section, click the macOS installer link from step 1
    - click download to download Anaconda3-2022.05-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
    - open the .pkg file
    - follow installation steps in pop-up window (e.g allow Anaconda to make changes to downloads folder)
    - to check if Anaconda downloaded properly, open Terminal and enter:

    cd /Users/<Your_Computer_User>/ (to change directory)
    cat .bash_profile (show contents of a file)   ->   First line should look like "# >>> conda initialize >>>" 

    - when you know Anaconda is properly initialized you can open Python by typing, in your terminal:

    ipython

    - Python will begin in your terminal window. You will know this becasue the terminal will display:
        1. the version of python your on and the date
        2. copyright infromation 
        3. the ipython version
 
    - then, you will be on your first line in a python interpriter.
    - test to see if your Python window works by typing your first python code:
 
    print("Hello World")
 
    - output should jsut display a Hello World
    - when you are done with python, you can just enter:
 
    exit
 
    - this will put you back in the original terminal window
